# Advanced

## Execution Only

We recommend that during the development of large programs (> 1 million cycles) you do not generate proofs each time.
Instead, you should have your script only execute the program with the RISC-V runtime and read `public_values`. Here is an example:

<Execute />

If the execution of your program succeeds, then proof generation should succeed as well! (Unless there is a bug in our zkVM implementation.)

## Logging and Tracing Information

You can use `utils::setup_logger()` to enable logging information respectively. You should only use one or the other of these functions.

**Logging:**

```rust
utils::setup_logger();
```

You must run your command with:

```bash
RUST_LOG=info cargo run --release
```

## CPU Acceleration

To enable CPU acceleration, you can use the `RUSTFLAGS` environment variable to enable the `target-cpu=native` flag when running your script. This will enable the compiler to generate code that is optimized for your CPU.

```bash
RUSTFLAGS='-C target-cpu=native' cargo run --release
```

Currently there is support for AVX512 and NEON SIMD instructions. For NEON, you must also enable the `sp1-sdk` feature `neon` in your script crate's `Cargo.toml` file.

```toml
sp1-sdk = { version = "...", features = ["neon"] }
```

## Performance

For maximal performance, you should run proof generation with the following command and vary your `shard_size` depending on your program's number of cycles.

```rust
SHARD_SIZE=4194304 RUST_LOG=info RUSTFLAGS='-C target-cpu=native' cargo run --release
```

## Memory Usage

To reduce memory usage, set the `SHARD_BATCH_SIZE` environment variable depending on how much RAM
your machine has. A higher number will use more memory, but will be faster.

```rust
SHARD_BATCH_SIZE=1 SHARD_SIZE=2097152 RUST_LOG=info RUSTFLAGS='-C target-cpu=native' cargo run --release
```

## Advanced Allocator

SP1 programs use a simple bump allocator by default, which just increments a pointer to allocate memory. Although this works for many cases, some programs can still run out of memory in the SP1 zkVM. To address this, you can enable the `embedded` allocator feature on the SP1 zkVM.

The embedded allocator uses the [`embedded-alloc` crate](https://crates.io/crates/embedded-alloc) and offers more flexible memory management, albeit with extra cycle overhead.

To enable it, add the following to your `sp1-zkvm` dependency in `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
sp1-zkvm = { version = "...", features = ["embedded"] }
```

Once enabled, the embedded allocator replaces the default bump allocator.
