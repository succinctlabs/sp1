# Compiling Programs

Once you have written an SP1 program, you must compile it to an ELF file that can be executed in the zkVM. The `cargo prove` CLI tool (downloaded during installation) provides convenient commands for compiling SP1 programs.

## Development Builds

> WARNING: Running `cargo prove build` may not generate a reproducible ELF which is necessary for verifying that your binary corresponds to given source code.
>
> Use SP1's [reproducible build system](#production-builds) for production builds.

To build a program while developing, simply run the following command in the crate that contains your SP1 program:

```bash
# Enter the directory containing your SP1 program.
cd path/to/your/program

# Build the program.
cargo prove build
```

This will compile the ELF that can be executed in the zkVM. The output from the command will look similar to this:

```bash
[sp1]     Compiling version_check v0.9.4
[sp1]     Compiling proc-macro2 v1.0.86
[sp1]     Compiling unicode-ident v1.0.12
[sp1]     Compiling cfg-if v1.0.0
...
[sp1]     Compiling sp1-lib v1.0.1
[sp1]     Compiling sp1-zkvm v1.0.1
[sp1]     Compiling fibonacci-program v0.1.0 (/Users/username/Documents/fibonacci/program)
[sp1]      Finished `release` profile [optimized] target(s) in 8.33s
```

Under the hood, this CLI command calls `cargo build` with the `riscv32im-succinct-zkvm-elf` target and other required environment variables and flags. The logic for this command is defined in the [sp1-build](https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1/tree/main/build) crate.

### Advanced Build Options

The `cargo prove build` command supports several configuration options to customize the build process for your program:

- `--features`: Enable specific features
- `--output-directory`: Specify a custom output location for the ELF
- `--elf-name`: Set a custom name for the output ELF file
- `--no-default-features`: Disable default features
- `--locked`: Ensure Cargo.lock remains unchanged
- `--packages`: Build only specified packages
- `--binaries`: Build only specified binaries

Run `cargo prove build --help` to see the complete list of options. Some options mirror those available in the standard `cargo build` command.

## Production Builds

For production builds, use Docker to generate a **reproducible ELF** that will be identical across all platforms. Simply add the `--docker` flag to your build command. You can also specify a release version using `--tag`, otherwise the tag defaults to the latest release. For example:

```bash
cargo prove build --docker --tag v4.0.0
```

To verify that your build is truly reproducible across different platforms and systems, compute the SHA-512 hash of the generated ELF file. The hash should be identical regardless of where you build it:

```bash
$ shasum -a 512 elf/riscv32im-succinct-zkvm-elf
f9afb8caaef10de9a8aad484c4dd3bfa54ba7218f3fc245a20e8a03ed40b38c617e175328515968aecbd3c38c47b2ca034a99e6dbc928512894f20105b03a203
```

## Build Script

If you want your program crate to be built automatically whenever you build/run your script crate, you can add a `build.rs` file inside of `script/` (at the same level as `Cargo.toml` of your script crate) that utilizes the `sp1-build` crate:

<Example/>

The path passed in to `build_program` should point to the directory containing the `Cargo.toml` file for your program. Make sure to also add `sp1-build` as a build dependency in `script/Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[build-dependencies]
sp1-build = "4.0.0"
```

You will see output like the following from the build script if the program has changed, indicating that the program was rebuilt:

```
[fibonacci-script 0.1.0] cargo:rerun-if-changed=../program/src
[fibonacci-script 0.1.0] cargo:rerun-if-changed=../program/Cargo.toml
[fibonacci-script 0.1.0] cargo:rerun-if-changed=../program/Cargo.lock
[fibonacci-script 0.1.0] cargo:warning=fibonacci-program built at 2024-03-02 22:01:26
[fibonacci-script 0.1.0] [sp1]    Compiling fibonacci-program v0.1.0 (/Users/umaroy/Documents/fibonacci/program)
[fibonacci-script 0.1.0] [sp1]     Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 0.15s
warning: fibonacci-script@0.1.0: fibonacci-program built at 2024-03-02 22:01:26
```

The above output was generated by running `RUST_LOG=info cargo run --release -vv` for the `script` folder of the Fibonacci example.

### Advanced Build Options

To configure the build process when using the `sp1-build` crate, you can pass a [`BuildArgs`](https://docs.rs/sp1-build/latest/sp1_build/struct.BuildArgs.html) struct to to the [`build_program_with_args`](https://docs.rs/sp1-build/latest/sp1_build/fn.build_program_with_args.html) function. The build arguments are the same as the ones available from the `cargo prove build` command.

As an example, you could use the following code to build the Fibonacci example with the `docker` flag set to `true` and a custom name for the generated ELF. This will generate a reproducible ELF file (with Docker) with the name `fibonacci-elf`:

```rust
use sp1_build::{build_program_with_args, BuildArgs};

fn main() {
    let args = BuildArgs {
        docker: true,
        elf_name: "fibonacci-elf".to_string(),
        ..Default::default()
    };
    build_program_with_args("../program", &args);
}
```
