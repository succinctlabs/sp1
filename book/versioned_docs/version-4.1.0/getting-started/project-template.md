# Project Template

Another option for getting started with SP1 is to use the [SP1 Project Template](https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1-project-template/tree/main).

You can use this as a Github template to create a new repository that has a SP1 program, a script to generate proofs, and also a contracts folder that contains a Solidity contract that can verify SP1 proofs on any EVM chain.
