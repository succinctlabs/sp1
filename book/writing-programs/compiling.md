# Compiling Programs

Once you have written an SP1 program, you must compile it to an ELF file that can be executed in the zkVM. The `cargo prove` CLI tool (downloaded during installation) provides convenient commands for compiling SP1 programs.

## Development Builds

> WARNING: This may not generate a reproducible ELF which is necessary for verifying that your binary corresponds to given source code.
>
> Use the [reproducible build system](#reproducible-builds-with-docker-production) for production builds.

To build a program while developing, simply run the following command in the crate that contains your SP1 program:

```bash
cargo prove build
```

This will compile the ELF that can be executed in the zkVM. The output from the command will look something like this:

```bash
[sp1]     Compiling version_check v0.9.4
[sp1]     Compiling proc-macro2 v1.0.86
[sp1]     Compiling unicode-ident v1.0.12
[sp1]     Compiling cfg-if v1.0.0
...
[sp1]     Compiling sp1-lib v1.0.1
[sp1]     Compiling sp1-zkvm v1.0.1
[sp1]     Compiling fibonacci-program v0.1.0 (/Users/username/Documents/fibonacci/program)
[sp1]      Finished `release` profile [optimized] target(s) in 8.33s
```

Under the hood, this CLI command calls `cargo build` with the `riscv32im-succinct-zkvm-elf` target and other required environment variables and flags. The logic for this command is defined in the [sp1-build](https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1/tree/main/build) crate.

### Advanced Build Options

You can pass additional arguments to the `cargo prove build` command to customize the build process, like configuring what features are enabled, customizing the output directory and more. To see all available options, run `cargo prove build --help`. Many of these options mirror the options available in the `cargo build` command.

## Production Builds

For production builds of programs, you can build your program inside a Docker container which will generate a **reproducible ELF** on all platforms. To do so, just use the `--docker` flag and optionally the `--tag` flag with the release version you want to use (defaults to `latest`). For example:

```bash
cargo prove build --docker --tag v1.0.1
```

To verify that your build is reproducible, you can compute the SHA-512 hash of the ELF on different platforms and systems with:

```bash
$ shasum -a 512 elf/riscv32im-succinct-zkvm-elf
f9afb8caaef10de9a8aad484c4dd3bfa54ba7218f3fc245a20e8a03ed40b38c617e175328515968aecbd3c38c47b2ca034a99e6dbc928512894f20105b03a203
```

## Build Script

If you want your program crate to be built automatically whenever you build/run your script crate, you can add a `build.rs` file inside of `script/` (at the same level as `Cargo.toml` of your script crate) that utilizes the `sp1-build` crate:

```rust,noplayground
{{#include ../../examples/fibonacci/script/build.rs}}
```

The path passed in to `build_program` should point to the directory containing the `Cargo.toml` file for your program. Make sure to also add `sp1-build` as a build dependency in `script/Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[build-dependencies]
sp1-build = "3.0.0"
```

You will see output like the following from the build script if the program has changed, indicating that the program was rebuilt:

```
[fibonacci-script 0.1.0] cargo:rerun-if-changed=../program/src
[fibonacci-script 0.1.0] cargo:rerun-if-changed=../program/Cargo.toml
[fibonacci-script 0.1.0] cargo:rerun-if-changed=../program/Cargo.lock
[fibonacci-script 0.1.0] cargo:warning=fibonacci-program built at 2024-03-02 22:01:26
[fibonacci-script 0.1.0] [sp1]    Compiling fibonacci-program v0.1.0 (/Users/umaroy/Documents/fibonacci/program)
[fibonacci-script 0.1.0] [sp1]     Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 0.15s
warning: fibonacci-script@0.1.0: fibonacci-program built at 2024-03-02 22:01:26
```

The above output was generated by running `RUST_LOG=info cargo run --release -vv` for the `script` folder of the Fibonacci example.

### Advanced Build Options

To configure the build process when using the `sp1-build` crate, you can pass a [`BuildArgs`](https://docs.rs/sp1-build/latest/sp1_build/struct.BuildArgs.html) struct to to the [`build_program_with_args`](https://docs.rs/sp1-build/latest/sp1_build/fn.build_program_with_args.html) function. The build arguments are the same as the ones available from the `cargo prove build` command.

As an example, you could use the following code to build the Fibonacci example with the `docker` flag set to `true` and a custom output directory for the generated ELF:

```rust,noplayground
use sp1_build::{build_program_with_args, BuildArgs};

fn main() {
    let args = BuildArgs {
        docker: true,
        output_directory: "./fibonacci-program".to_string(),
        ..Default::default()
    };
    build_program_with_args("../program", &args);
}
```

**Note:** If you want reproducible builds with the `build.rs` approach, you should use the `docker` flag and the `build_program_with_args` function, as shown in the example above.
