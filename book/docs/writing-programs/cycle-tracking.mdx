# Cycle Tracking

When writing a program, it is useful to know how many RISC-V cycles a portion of the program takes to identify potential performance bottlenecks. SP1 provides a way to track the number of cycles spent in a portion of the program.

## Tracking Cycles with Annotations

To track the number of cycles spent in a portion of the program, you can either put `println!("cycle-tracker-start: block name")` + `println!("cycle-tracker-end: block name")` statements (block name must be same between start and end) around the portion of your program you want to profile or use the `#[sp1_derive::cycle_tracker]` macro on a function. An example is shown below:

<Example />

Note that to use the macro, you must add the `sp1-derive` crate to your dependencies for your program.

```toml
[dependencies]
sp1-derive = "4.0.0-rc.8"
```

In the script for proof generation, setup the logger with `utils::setup_logger()` and run the script with `RUST_LOG=info cargo run --release`. You should see the following output:

```
$ RUST_LOG=info cargo run --release

```

Note that we elegantly handle nested cycle tracking, as you can see above.

### Get Tracked Cycle Counts

To include tracked cycle counts in the `ExecutionReport` when using `ProverClient::execute`, use the following annotations:

```rust
fn main() {
  println!("cycle-tracker-report-start: block name");
  // ...
  println!("cycle-tracker-report-end: block name");
}
```

This will log the cycle count for `block name` and include it in the `ExecutionReport` in the `cycle_tracker` map.

### Profiling a ZKVM program

Profiling a zkVM program produces a useful visualization ([example profile](https://share.firefox.dev/3Om1pzz)) which makes it easy to examine program performance and see exactly where VM cycles are being spent without needing to modify the program at all.

To profile a program, you need to:

1. Enable the profiling feature for `sp1-sdk` in `script/Cargo.toml`
2. Set the env variable `TRACE_FILE=trace.json` and then call `ProverClient::execute()` in your script.

If you're executing a larger program (>100M cycles), you should set `TRACE_SAMPLE_RATE` to reduce the size of the trace file. A sample rate of `1000` means that 1 in every 1000 VM cycles is sampled. By default, every cycle is sampled.

Many examples can be found in the repo, such as this ['fibonacci'](https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1/blob/dev/examples/fibonacci/script/src/main.rs#L22) script.

Once you have your script it should look like the following:

```rs
    // Execute the program using the `ProverClient.execute` method, without generating a proof.
    let (_, report) = client.execute(ELF, &stdin).run().unwrap();
```

As well you must enable the profiling feature on the SDK:

```toml
    sp1-sdk = { version = "4.0.0-rc.8", features = ["profiling"] }
```

The `TRACE_FILE` env var tells the executor where to save the profile, and the `TRACE_SAMPLE_RATE` env var tells the executor how often to sample the program.
A larger sample rate will give you a smaller profile, it is the number of instructions in between each sample.

The full command to profile should look something like this

```sh
    TRACE_FILE=output.json TRACE_SAMPLE_RATE=100 cargo run ...
```

To view these profiles, we recommend [Samply](https://github.com/mstange/samply).

```sh
    cargo install --locked samply
    samply load output.json
```

Samply uses the Firefox profiler to create a nice visualization of your programs execution.

#### Interpreting the Profile

- The "time" measurement in the profiler is actually the number of cycles spent,
  in general the less cycles for a given callframe the better.

- The CPU usage of the program will always be constant, as its running in the VM which is single threaded.
