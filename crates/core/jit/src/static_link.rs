//! Static-link support for [`crate::JitFunction`].
//!
//! When a [`crate::CompiledCode`] is written to a `.S` file via
//! [`crate::CompiledCode::write_asm`] and assembled into an `.o` object, all
//! fields of the compiled program are exposed as global linker symbols:
//!
//! | Symbol                      | Type                    | Content                              |
//! |-----------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|
//! | `sp1_jit_code`              | function                | JIT prologue / entry point           |
//! | `sp1_jump_table`            | `[*const u8]`           | Absolute instruction addresses       |
//! | `sp1_jump_table_len`        | `u64`                   | Number of jump-table entries         |
//! | `sp1_ecall_ptr_offsets`     | `[u64]`                 | ECALL patch-site offsets             |
//! | `sp1_ecall_ptr_offsets_len` | `u64`                   | Number of ECALL patch sites          |
//! | `sp1_unimp_ptr_offsets`     | `[u64]`                 | UNIMP patch-site offsets             |
//! | `sp1_unimp_ptr_offsets_len` | `u64`                   | Number of UNIMP patch sites          |
//! | `sp1_pc_start`              | `u64`                   | Starting program counter             |
//! | `sp1_pc_base`               | `u64`                   | Base program counter                 |
//! | `sp1_memory_size`           | `u64`                   | VM memory region size in bytes       |
//!
//! This module declares those symbols as `extern "C"` so the Rust compiler
//! knows they exist; the linker resolves their addresses when the final binary
//! is built from `out.o` (produced by `as` or `clang -c`).
//!
//! # Usage
//! ```sh
//! # 1. Emit the assembly file from your compiled program:
//! #    (call CompiledCode::write_asm_to_file in a build step)
//!
//! # 2. Assemble:
//! as -o out.o out.S          # or: clang -c -o out.o out.S
//!
//! # 3. Link with your binary:
//! #    Add out.o to the link inputs (e.g. via build.rs or a linker script).
//!
//! # 4. Enable the feature and call:
//! #    MinimalExecutor::from_static_link(program, max_trace_size)
//! ```
