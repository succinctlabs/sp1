# SP1 SDK

The Software Development Kit (SDK) for building zero-knowledge applications with SP1.

## Overview

The SP1 SDK provides a high-level interface for developers to write zero-knowledge programs in Rust. It abstracts away the complexity of zero-knowledge proof systems while providing full access to Rust's standard library and ecosystem.
