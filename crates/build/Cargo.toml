# Note: The release workflow depends on `sp1-build` version being set by the workspace, and that the `sp1-build` version refers to the canonical version.
# **Do not change this**, unless the release workflow is changed accordingly.
#
# The version of `sp1-build` is used for:
# - The name of the release tag on merge to `main`.
# - The default Docker image tag for this SP1 version..
