# Contributing to SP1

Thanks for your interest in improving SP1!

There are many ways to contribute at any level. Whether you're just getting started with Rust or you're already an expert, your help is welcome.

No contribution is too small—every contribution is valued.

This document is a guide to help you get started. Don’t let it intimidate you; it’s here to help you navigate the process.

If you have questions not addressed in this guide, feel free to ask in the Telegram group.

## Code of Conduct

The SP1 project follows the Rust Code of Conduct. This outlines the minimum behavior expected from all contributors.

Violations can be reported to the team directly.

---

## Ways to Contribute

You can contribute in several ways:

- **Open an issue**: If you believe you’ve found a bug in SP1, open an issue to report it.
- **Add context**: Share screenshots, logs, or code snippets that can help clarify existing issues.
- **Fix issues**: Submit a pull request to fix bugs or confirm if an issue is no longer valid.

We encourage you to join discussions, help review PRs, and grow with the community.

> 🔤 _Note: At this time, we are not accepting contributions that only fix spelling or grammar errors._

## Asking for Help

If you've reviewed the documentation and still have questions, you can ask for help by [opening a discussion](../../discussions). Click the **Discussions** tab at the top.

Since SP1 is under heavy development, documentation may sometimes be incomplete. The [SP1 Book](https://docs.succinct.xyz/docs/sp1/introduction) is our best effort to provide updated information.

---

## Submitting a Bug Report

When submitting a bug report, please include:

- The SP1 version you're using
- Your platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.)
- Any relevant code snippets
- Exact steps to reproduce the bug

Keep examples minimal and self-contained when possible.

---

## Submitting a Feature Request

Clearly describe the feature you'd like to see. Include context and examples (other tools, workflows) if helpful.

---

## Resolving an Issue

Pull requests (PRs) are the main way to propose changes to the code, documentation, or dependencies.

Even small PRs—such as wording improvements—are welcome. For major changes, open an issue first to get feedback.

For large features, start with a **draft PR** to avoid duplication.

---

## Adding Tests

If you're changing code, please include tests:

- **Unit tests**: For specific functions
- **Integration tests**: For broader functionality. Refer to existing tests for guidance.

---

## Commit Best Practices

- Keep commits logically grouped.
- Squash trivial commits when possible.
- Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format for commit messages and PR titles:
  - `feat:` for new features
  - `fix:` for bug fixes
  - `docs:` for documentation changes
  - `refactor:` for non-feature/non-bug code changes
  - `chore:` for build/tooling changes
  - `test:` for test additions/updates

**Examples**:

## Opening a Pull Request

When opening a PR, fill out the template as best you can. It’s okay to skip parts if unsure.

---

## Discuss and Update

You may receive feedback on your PR. That’s expected!

Collaboration improves the codebase and helps you grow as a contributor. All PRs are opportunities to grow the SP1 community—even if they’re not merged.

---

## Reviewing PRs

Anyone is welcome to review pull requests.

Be helpful, respectful, and constructive in your feedback. Dismissive or vague reviews go against our Code of Conduct.

---

## Abandoned PRs

If a PR appears stalled, check with the contributor before continuing their work. If you take over, give credit using `Author:` or `Co-authored-by:` in the commit message.
